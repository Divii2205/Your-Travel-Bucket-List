### Features
- Add new travel destinations to the bucket list.
- Provide detailed information about each destination.
- Username input through a modal dialog box.

### File Structure
The project consists of the following main files:

1. **index.html** (Main HTML file)
2. **styles.css** (CSS file for styling the webpage)
3. **script.js** (JavaScript file for handling interactivity)
